# AirBnB Clone

## Description of the project

This project is meant to copy the workings of the Web Application AirBnB. This AirBnB clone is meant to translate the web application to a commandline interface with just some not all of the features.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a terminal application that tries to miimic the otherwise event driven web application of the AirBnB company

The command interpreter is started by executing a python file that contains commands that enable it listen either interactively or non interactively by using the ./console.py or running it with file arguments

We use it by entering different commands to simulate the event driven nature of the actual site

For example create client to create the client of the AirBnB system and allocate his fdesired resources
